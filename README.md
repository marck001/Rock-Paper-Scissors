# Rock-Paper-Scissors in python
## Description:
This is a simple GUI rock-paper-scissors program implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The application follows a class structure. About the game mode, it pits the player against the computer, which makes random choices because of its logic. A match concludes when either the player or the computer reaches a score of 5 points. This project was created for practice purposes in python.

## Installation:
To run the program, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

1. Tkinter Library: Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations. If you encounter an issue with Tkinter not being available, you can install it using the following command:
```console
pip install tk
```
Ignore the above command if it doesn't raise an error.

2. Pillow Library: Install the PILLOW library for image processing in your terminal:
```console
pip install pillow
```
